# Car-Price-Prediction
This project predicts car prices using machine learning. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding, and splitting into training/testing sets. XGBoost performed best (Training MSE: 560M, Testing MSE: 1.56B), followed by Random Forest. Polynomial regression overfitted, while KNN &amp; SVR underperformed.
